Web Design Homework Assignement

In this assignment we were asked to create a webpage dashboard to showcase findings from our WeatherPy API homework assignment. We compared various aspects of weather compared to its longitudinal value across cities all over the world. 

We created 7 pages including:
- Landing page
- 4 Visualization pages 
- A comparison page
- A data page

For every page we created a navigation bar. We also made sure that the site is responsive to all types of media - ie phones and laptops. 

We also took data from a csv file, turn it into a pandas dataframe, and then turned that in HTML code.
